460453127670985,"From Sgt. Robert Brown US Army

Nobody has a ""right"" to serve in the Military.  Nobody. 

What makes people think the Military is an equal opportunity employer?  Very far from it.  

The Military uses prejudice regularly and consistently to deny citizens from joining for being too old or too young, too fat or too skinny, too tall or too short.  

Citizens are denied for having flat feet, or for missing or additional fingers.  Poor eyesight will disqualify you, as well as bad teeth.  Malnourished?  Drug addiction?  Bad back?  Criminal history?  Low IQ?  Anxiety?  Phobias?  Hearing damage?  Six arms?  Hear voices in your head?  Self-identify as a Unicorn?  Need a special access ramp for your wheelchair?  Can't run the requred course in the required time?  Can't do the required number of pushups?

Not really a ""morning person"" and refuse to get out of bed before noon?   

All can be reasons for denial.  

The Military has one job.  War.  Anything else is a distraction and a liability. 

Did someone just scream ""That isn't Fair""?  War is VERY unfair, there are no exceptions made for being special or challenged or socially wonderful.  

YOU change yourself to meet Military standards.  Not the other way around.  

I say again:  You don't change the Military... you must change yourself.  

The Military doesn't need to accomodate anyone with special issues.  The Military needs to Win Wars.  

If any of your personal issues are a liability that detract from readiness or lethality... Thank you for applying and good luck in future endeavors.

10153427513811323,"What does the word Humanity mean? 
It means to love, to care, to show compassion, to practice and preach helping each other in our emotional and physical times of distress. To show acceptance and respect towards each other as fellow living beings (for all living beings). These essential and natural elements of humanity existed and come to existence much before man made ideas, practices, beliefs and expectations (religions, societies, mythologies, ideologies, etc.) A child of any species first takes birth as a living being, belonging to him/her/it self first and foremost later on the families, societies, communities and ourselves start identifying with something or the other- in most cases it's a clever imposition. This child that takes birth as itself is taking birth as a living being and the only thing it truly belongs to is it's own inner light- inner compassion, inner love and humanity.
Today in the USA, Humanity has won over regressive ideas, beliefs, emotions and feelings of hatred, disrespectfulness, segregation and discrimination. 

Congratulations to us all to be a part of a society and country that believes in 'Inclusion' and not 'exclusion'. We need to understand everything in nature, is Natural! Now that the LGBTQ community has been embraced with open arms and humanity, we should make attempts and take strong steps in providing equality to other minority groups or groups being sidelined- we should open ourselves towards understanding and embracing groups belonging to all skin colors (African Americans, Asians, Caucasians, etc.), genders, mental and physical limitations, animals rights, children's rights, etc.
A historical day in the U.S. and the world today. Thank you Supreme court!
Good wishes of peace, love and a happy life for one and all.

2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.
4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
6 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.
7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.
8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.

Judges 11:29-40
29 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites. 30 And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: “If you give the Ammonites into my hands, 31 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.”
32 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands. 33 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon.
34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.”
36 “My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the Lord. Do to me just as you promised, now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites. 37 But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.”
38 “You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. 
39 After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin.From this comes the Israelite tradition

He crossed Gilead and Manasseh , passed through Mizpah of Gilead , and from there he advanced against the Ammonites . 30 And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord : “ If you give the Ammonites into my hands , 31 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord ’s , and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering . ” 32 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites , and the Lord gave them into his hands . 33 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith , as far as Abel Keramim . Thus Israel subdued Ammon. 34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah , who should come out to meet him but his daughter , dancing to the sound of timbrels ! She was an only child . Except for her he had neither son nor daughter . 35 When he saw her , he tore his clothes and cried , “ Oh no , my daughter ! You have brought me down and I am devastated . I have made a vow to the Lord that I can not break . ” 36 “ My father , ” she replied , “ you have given your word to the Lord . Do to me just as you promised , now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies , the Ammonites . 37 But grant me this one request , ” she said . “ Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends , because I will never marry . ” 38 “ You may go , ” he said . And he let her go for two months . She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry . 39 After the two months , she returned to her father , and he did to her as he had vowed . And she was a virgin . From this comes the Israelite tradition 40 that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite .","Exodus 21 : 1 - 11 1 now these be the judgment which thou shalt set before they . 2 if thou buy a Hebrew servant , six year he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing . 3 if he come in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he be marry , then he wife shall go out with he . 4 if he master have give he a wife , and she have bear he son or daughter ; the wife and she child shall be she master 's , and he shall go out by himself . 5 and if the servant shall plainly say , I love my master , my wife , and my child ; I will not go out free : 6 then he master shall bring he unto the judge ; he shall also bring he to the door , or unto the door post ; and he master shall bear he ear through with a aul ; and he shall serve he for ever . 7 and if a man sell he daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the menservant do . 8 if she please not she master , who hath betroth she to himself , then shall he let she be redeem : to sell she unto a strange nation he shall have no power , see he hath deal deceitfully with she . 9 and if he have betroth she unto he son , he shall deal with she after the manner of daughter . 10 if he take he another wife ; she food , she raiment , and she duty of marriage , shall he not diminish . 11 and if he do not these three unto she , then shall she go out free without money . judge 11:29-40 29 then the Spirit of the Lord come on Jephthah . he cross gilead and Manasseh , pass through Mizpah of gilead , and from there he advanced against the ammonite . 30 and Jephthah make a vow to the Lord : "" if you give the ammonite into my hand , 31 whatever come out of the door of my house to meet I when I return in triumph from the ammonite will be the Lord 's , and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering .

10 So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children. 11 “This is what you are to do,” they said. “Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.” 12 They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.

13 Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon. 14 So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.

15 The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel. 16 And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left? 17 The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 18 We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’ 19 But look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”

20 So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards 21 and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin. 22 When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’”

23 So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.
