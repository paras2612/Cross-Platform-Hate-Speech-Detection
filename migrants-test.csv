The Islamic religion is going through a similar scenario of extremists like Christianity did as well as probably all religions (over generalizing but you get the point, hopefully).

10153276251362217,"Just to clarify I am not muslim so this is not MY religion. I have had the chance to live in Iraq (half my life), UAE and the UK so I have tiptoed into both worlds ‘us vs them’. 

Delina: i think the most important thing you have to question is whether muslims believe that these things you mentioned apply today or whether they apply at all. 

1. The whole muhammad marrying Aysha at the age of 9 is debated heavily within the muslim community itself. Some say she wasn’t 9. Even if she was we need to remember that we are talking about 1,400 years ago where there are numerous cases of such things happening within that region. Most importantly, do muslims marry 9 year olds. Rarely. I’ve only heard of cases in Egypt and Saudi. So muslims do not agree with this and it rarely occurs.  
2. Nearly all muslims believe that the whole slavery thing is misinterpreted. People interpret it as during war when you come across women do not make them the untouchables and that you should marry them if you want (marriage in the quran requires both consents) and treat them equally. With regards to other slaves, muslims believe that their prophet brought a lot of new rights to salves, changing the roman slavery rules. In addition, a lot of slaves were freed.  A lot of the things I have read confirm this. 

3. The whole marrying 4 i think was there to spread Islam. I have never come across anyone in my life that has married more than 1 and tbh it only happens in some societies like Saudia Arabia. Nearly all muslims marry 1 person. So again applicable then and not now. 

4.Women rights. The whole covering your self completely is simply incorrect. Quran requires you to be modest and not for full out covering. It’s more of a culture thing (or should i say a tribal thing) plus people used to wear it for protection from the sand. I am not joking when I say this but during my 13 years in Baghdad i saw less burkas than in my 3 years in London. In the society I lived in, all my friends' muslim moms went to uni, had jobs and lived equally to men. Within the same families you can find women covering their hair and some that don't. Different interpretation of modesty. This is in Iraq, UAE and the UK. Saudi Arabia is not how the majority of muslim women live and really does not represent Islam. FGM for example again only happens in some societies and not across the muslim world. In fact its mostly an african thing and happens a lot in non-muslim countries. 

5. Your statement that muslims have only brought misery to the west is a bit extreme. you have put Sunnis, Shias, Alawites, Whabasim, Ahmadeyia, Druze and many others all in one group. Muslim immigration has worked wonderfully in some situations and haven’t worked in other situations. This depends on a lot of factors such as the people coming to the west, the people receiving the immigrants, the programs in place to connect both. For examples, there are so so many muslims in the NHS. If we are going through the route of blaming the whole group then the middle east can say the same about the west. The west has only brought misery to the middle east, from the Sykes-Picot agreement, to the overthrow of the Iranian government in 1953, to supporting Saddam, supporting Al qaeda against the russions, illegally occupying Iraq, supplying weapons to the Syrian rebels, giving weapons to Qaddafi and then taking him out and supporting countries with extreme ideologies. How many dictators have the west supported? Should we block all the west from entering the middle east. Should we build walls around every country in the world. 

So the misconception people have with Islam is to do with the Quran. Do muslims apply certain verses to their everyday life or do they think that some verses only apply to the past with some parts being story telling. The quran is in arabic, written 1,400 years ago, so are we interpreting the quran correctly? I am sure how things were said 1400 years ago is different to how we speak now. In my experience, most of the muslims i know, and I know a lot given that i used to live in Iraq and the UAE, agree that some versers are not applicable today or they interpret those verses differently.

The behaviour of Hungary is disgraceful.
In italy we had migrants for so many years. Every week they come by boats, we shelter them and don't make walls.Many of them die in the water, ordinary people run in the water to save them. We have lot of controversies in ur nation cos many people don't want them to come, but while they land , and are in need, there is nothing else to do then shelter them with humanity, and this is what people in Lampedusa do.
Hungarians know it very well as they were migrants htemselves during the period of their need back in the revolution in the 50s.
Over 200,000 of them escaped looking for shelter in the western countries and now that few thousands are in need, they build a wall.
Look at ho the hungarians were sheltered at that time.
Short of memory?

The Hungarians stayed in the refugee-camp as long as they were ordered to do so and left the camps only when they were allowed to. The Hungarians have used their passports to identify themselves and have accepted the registration process.

And at last there were only 200.000 Hungarians, while there are 4.000.000 Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugees do not stay in their neighbour countries but they move toward to other countries upon their guess and without any documents. They cross green borders without permit and they do not want to use the OPEN border stations, although those are OPEN. They do not want themselves to be registrated and do not want to stay in the refugee-camps. Instead of co-operating with the local authorities, they attack the borders and the policemen.

The problem is as follows:

2. They entered the EU in Greece;
3. They were invited by Ms Merkel;
4. Hungary build walls.

Basically everyone has failed eastern Europe.  1) The refugees should not have left the countries they escaped to - the UN should have made sure they stayed in the camps, and were registered.  2) Merkel basically sent out an invite to a free party in Germany, and slammed the door in the faces of people who turned up, because her house was full.  3)  With nowhere to go, the refugees were stuck in Hungary, who quickly worked out they couldn't handle the numbers, so did the same as Germany, and stopped them coming in...  thus pushing the problem further back down the line.  The problem is when you plug one hole in a dam, it doesn't stop the pressure building up, it will just break out somewhere else - like Croatia or Serbia.  So Eastern Europe as a whole is in a no-win situation - if you individually keep them out, you are called inhumane, even if you can't cope with the burden.   If you decide to let them through, you are technically breaking the law.

However the only way that would work is if it is a temporary solution , and the refugees are able , and actively encouraged to return home at the earliest opportunity . { As it happens , the paraphrasing still turned out to be quite long - sorry :) }","Eszter - I will paraphrase a ( very long ) response I post on Gergely Dian 's comment thread .... basically everyone have fail eastern Europe . 1 ) the refuge should not have leave the country they escape to - the UN should have make sure they stay in the camp , and be register . 2 ) Merkel basically send out a invite to a free party in Germany , and slam the door in the face of people who turn up , because she house be full . 3 ) with nowhere to go , the refuge be stick in Hungary , who quickly work out they could not handle the number , so do the same as Germany , and stop they come in ... thus push the problem further back down the line . the problem be when you plug one hole in a dam , it do not stop the pressure build up , it will just break out somewhere else - like Croatia or Serbia . so eastern Europe as a whole be in a no-win situation - if you individually keep they out , you be call inhumane , even if you can not cope with the burden . if you decide to let they through , you be technically break the law . the solution I propose be let those already move go to Germany and register , and ensure those in camp or those leave Syria stay in the camp and register . the UN will then be able to oversee they rights be upheld ( shelter and food - even if that mean camp in Germany , Austria etc. ) , or that the refuge be resettle as appropriate . however the only way that would work be if it be a temporary solution , and the refuge be able , and actively encourage to return home at the earliest opportunity . { as it happen , the paraphrasing still turn out to be quite long - sorry :) }",PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET PUNCT ADV ADV PUNCT NOUN PRON VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PART NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADV PRON AUX VERB ADJ PROPN PUNCT X PUNCT DET NOUN AUX PART AUX VERB DET NOUN PRON VERB ADP PUNCT DET PROPN AUX AUX VERB ADJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ AUX VERB PUNCT X PUNCT PROPN ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PRON VERB ADP PUNCT SCONJ PRON NOUN AUX ADJ PUNCT X PUNCT ADP ADV PART VERB PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON ADV VERB ADP PRON AUX PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADV AUX DET ADJ ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ VERB PRON VERB ADV PUNCT ADV VERB DET NOUN ADV ADV ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADV PRON VERB NUM NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX PART VERB DET NOUN VERB ADP PUNCT PRON AUX ADV VERB ADP ADV ADV PUNCT ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN PUNCT ADV ADJ PROPN SCONJ DET ADJ AUX ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON ADV VERB PRON ADP PUNCT PRON AUX VERB ADJ PUNCT ADV SCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PART VERB PRON ADV PUNCT PRON AUX ADV VERB DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PRON VERB AUX VERB PRON ADV VERB VERB ADP PROPN CCONJ VERB PUNCT CCONJ VERB PRON ADP NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PROPN VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN AUX ADV AUX ADJ PART VERB PRON NOUN AUX VERB PUNCT NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT ADV SCONJ PRON VERB NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PROPN X PUNCT PUNCT CCONJ SCONJ DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP ADJ PUNCT ADV DET ADJ NOUN PRON AUX VERB VERB SCONJ PRON AUX DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN AUX ADJ PUNCT CCONJ ADV VERB PART VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB PUNCT DET NOUN ADV VERB ADP PART AUX ADV ADV PUNCT ADJ SYM PUNCT

GERMANY TODAY REVERSES WHAT MARTEL HAS WON FOR EUROPE. 
The Battle of Tours 1356, was fought on October 10, 732 between forces under the Frankish leader Charles Martel and a massive invading Islamic army led by Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi Abd al Rahman, near the city of Tours, France. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. This battle stopped the northward advance of Islam from the Iberian peninsula, and is considered by most historians to be of macrohistorical importance, in that it halted the Islamic conquests, and preserved Christianity as the controlling faith in Europe, during a period in which Islam was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires.
Now while ISIS is overrunning Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Germany is opening its borders to Syrians, and thereby what Charles Martel achieved for Europe has been made fruitless.

10153766229406323,"So their story is tragic, indeed, but goes as follows: after war in their country they flee to the nearest safest place due to force majeure and seek refuge, for example in Turkey, where they also have an international legal status as refugees. Then, they don't like it there, for whatever reason, even though they are perfectly safe as refugees, and decide to illegally immigrate and walk or are driven by smugglers for 1700 km across Turkey's land to subsequently cross the sea into Greece, putting in danger their own and their children's lives by bringing more unnecessary treacherous hardship and toil unto themselves, utterly and wholly of their own accord. Meantime the media still calls them euphemistically ""refugees"" ad infinitum, long after they have chosen to do away with their legal status as refugees given that they immigrate illegally to other counties without being in any immediate danger, in fact even though they do not qualify as ""refugees"" in any sense of the word once they cross Turkey's border into Greece, neither in the legal sense under all international treaties, nor in the etymological sense; simply because for at least 1700-1900 km of land maybe way more and a stretch of rough sea with the help of an illegal smuggler whom they themselves paid, they illegally immigrate into a country two or ten borders seat from the one they had initially sought refuge into. 

So the small question is why are the media still all calling them refugees after they reach Greece, when CLEARLY BLATANTLY they are NOT in any sense of the word, legal or etymological or otherwise (compassion is not an excuse for bad journalism of forging skewed opinion shaping public perception).

What about Somalian children and people in general? They actually have it worse than Syrians in all respects, plus they don't make demands for halal food.

For your information, I'm 3rd generation Canadian actually, and using a Greek name on Facebook is because I teach Greek and English and don't want students finding me easily on Facebook, and secondarily because of my ancestry which you were so eager to observe duh. 

The fact that you actually decided to publicly attack and deride Greeks for what their country is going through regarding their economy, just because you ASSumed I'm Greek (as though Greeks don't have a right to tell people what is objectively true or not just because, as you said their economy is in tatters), when in actuality we are talking about: a) refugees and Syrians fleeing their country into Turkey where they are safe from war and b) their illegal immigration into Greece and Europe, and c) whether the media should continue to label illegal immigrants as refugees, is utterly schizophrenic in your part my friend and proves exactly how terribly messed up your way of thinking really is. 

As for Greeks, since you mention, given the fact that about 10,000 have died due to the economic crisis, and over 200,000 have legally immigrated due to the economic downturn also, that's all the more reason not to compound the Greek problems and incapacity to offer help by burdening Greece with the largest number of illegal immigrants in Europe.

I seriously doubt that American people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that French people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that Greeks are to blame for the mistakes and betrayal if their politicians and the stupid laws they pass and agreements they made and borrowed money they used.

There's 2.5 million that entered a Greece of a 10 million population in a very short year and a half, with a much as half a million arriving in the last few months spine, accounting for 1/4th of its population all on small islands with towns half that of the size of Moncton. That's like saying by analogy 10 million people came to Canada all within a few months in the smallest of towns. If that had happened here, you'd be crying like a petty spoiled whiner that you are for not being able to drive through the streets. So stop being naive. This is as much a crisis for the illegal immigrants as it is for those locals whose lives they are destroying. You have it easy, and you pick and choose sides too easily based on your preconceived notions. There's utter chaos in these circumstances and nothing is cut and dry. What is more, there's evidence these people are being urged to immigrate into Europe instead of dispersing in the surrounding vicinity of their country that is safe and where they are welcome and where they don't have to travel for 1800 km and pay smugglers 5 thousands euros per head to get to Europe when they're not even running away from danger any longer. Worse yet, countries like UAE, which are Muslim, wealthier than Germany and Greece and Italy and France combined, and a mere 200 km away from Syria have closed their borders to their Muslim brothers. 

To give you a sense of how irrationally wild it is that they specifically want to come to Greece, get this: Iraq is roughly the same distance: 1890 km from Greece. Where are all the Iraqis from the war there? What about all the Palestinians? They are closer. What about all the Egyptians? They could have just skipped over the sea onto Crete when there was war in their country, but hardly anyone came. What about people from Jordan, they are closer too. Where are they? Libyans didn't come to Greece either. So what's up with Syrians? They are neither the first nor the last to have war. What's the deal with this mass exodus of only males? When the war in Bosnia took place, none came to Greece and they are much much closer by a few hundred km. When the war in Kosovo broke out, no one came either nor dispersed into Europe. When the war in Ukraine came, hardly any mass migration took place. When the war in Yugoslavia took place that created FYROM and the such, hardly anyone moved about yet again. The scenario with Syrians is a first in recent history. Don't be so naive. All these men are draft dodgers too. They should be fighting for their country as they are able bodied, young and healthy. Who will rebuild their nation. At best I find this mass exodus suspiciously curious for destabilizing both Syria and Europe.

Libyans do not come to Greece either . so what be up with Syrians ? they be neither the first nor the last to have war . what be the deal with this mass exodus of only male ? when the war in Bosnia take place , none come to Greece and they be much much closer by a few hundred km . when the war in Kosovo break out , no one come either nor disperse into Europe . when the war in Ukraine come , hardly any mass migration take place . when the war in Yugoslavia take place that create FYROM and the such , hardly anyone move about yet again . the scenario with Syrians be a first in recent history . do not be so naive . all these man be draft dodger too . they should be fight for they country as they be able body , young and healthy . who will rebuild they nation . at best I find this mass exodus suspiciously curious for destabilize both Syria and Europe . start doub the news they feed you for a change and ask yourself question at all time .",PART ADV PUNCT PRON VERB NUM NUM PRON VERB DET PROPN ADP DET NUM NUM NOUN ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT ADP DET ADJ ADP DET DET NUM NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP PROPN ADP PRON NOUN ADV ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN DET PRON ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB SCONJ VERB ADP NOUN NUM NUM NOUN VERB ADP PROPN ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADP NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADV PUNCT PRON AUX AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN PRON PRON AUX SCONJ PART AUX ADJ PART VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV VERB AUX ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADV DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX ADP DET NOUN PRON NOUN PRON AUX VERB PUNCT PRON VERB PRON ADJ PUNCT CCONJ PRON VERB CCONJ VERB NOUN ADV ADV VERB ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ PRON AUX VERB CCONJ ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN DET NOUN AUX AUX VERB PART VERB ADP PROPN ADV SCONJ VERB ADP DET VERB NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PRON AUX ADJ CCONJ ADV PRON AUX ADJ CCONJ ADV PRON AUX PART VERB PART VERB ADP NUM NOUN CCONJ VERB NOUN NUM NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN PART VERB ADP PROPN ADV PRON AUX PART ADV VERB ADV ADP NOUN ADV ADV PUNCT ADJ ADV PUNCT NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT ADJ ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN VERB PUNCT CCONJ DET ADJ NUM NOUN ADV ADP PROPN AUX VERB PRON NOUN ADP PRON ADJ NOUN PUNCT PART VERB PRON DET NOUN SCONJ ADV ADV ADJ PRON VERB SCONJ PRON ADV VERB PART VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT VERB PRON PUNCT PROPN AUX ADV DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADV AUX DET DET PROPN ADP DET NOUN ADV PUNCT PRON ADP DET DET PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ PUNCT PRON ADP DET DET PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX AUX ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN ADV PRON VERB NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADV PRON VERB PUNCT PRON ADP NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADJ ADV PUNCT ADV AUX PRON PUNCT PROPN AUX PART VERB ADP PROPN ADV PUNCT ADV PRON AUX ADV ADP PROPN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV DET ADJ CCONJ DET ADJ PART VERB NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADV NOUN PUNCT ADV DET NOUN ADP PROPN VERB NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB ADP PROPN CCONJ PRON AUX ADV ADV ADJ ADP DET ADJ NUM NOUN PUNCT ADV DET NOUN ADP PROPN VERB ADP PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADV CCONJ VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT ADV DET NOUN ADP PROPN VERB PUNCT ADV DET ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN PUNCT ADV DET NOUN ADP PROPN VERB NOUN PRON VERB PROPN CCONJ DET ADJ PUNCT ADV PRON VERB ADV ADV ADV PUNCT DET NOUN ADP PROPN AUX DET ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT AUX PART AUX ADV ADJ PUNCT DET DET NOUN AUX NOUN NOUN ADV PUNCT PRON AUX AUX VERB ADP PRON NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX ADJ ADJ PUNCT ADJ CCONJ ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADV ADJ SCONJ VERB CCONJ PROPN CCONJ PROPN PUNCT VERB VERB DET NOUN PRON VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT

They control the prices the farmers charge, the prices the clothing manufactures charge, the prices the electrical manufactures charge and so on and in turn they control what you pay and buy and how you buy and how you pay.

Using Tesco as an example of one large organisation that changed the way every one lived and shopped and took away the individuality and freedom and choice from people and controlling everyone like sheep.

I do not mind people come to this country from other country as long as they have the money to fund themselves over here . if we go to another country we would have to have enough money to live for at least 5 year and would not get any benefit from those country either . if we do not have the money then we would not get in it be as simple as that . also we need to add boundary like if they have a criminal record no way would they get in , if they do not have the job specification they would not get in also that they would get no benefit whatsoever for a minimum of 5 year ( like Australia ) and then you would only get benefit after the 5 year point if you have be work for those 5 year and you get basic benefit at that point and the longer you have work the more you would be entitle too . if we bring in all those stipulation I would be fine with whoever come into this country as then I would know that they be not a drain on we economy . we be too nice to other minority in this country and forget about we own people and they need . we need to put we own people first and the other minority second . also we need to stop give they money for they child that be not even in this country also !!!!! every minority that come to this country should not be entitle to any free NHS , no money from DSS , no free housing etc they be the one want to come to this country it be not as if we be beg they to come here so they can claim benefit it be they choice and most come to this country ( not all ) only want to come to the UK because of everything they get when they arrive . if we stop hand out everything to they and give they nothing you can bet probably 80 % of those that want to come over here would not then want to come to this country as they would not get all the handout then and it be the handout that they be love and entice they here x",PRON VERB PART VERB VERB DET CCONJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN CCONJ VERB VERB NOUN NOUN ADV ADV SCONJ PRON VERB PUNCT PRON AUX PART VERB NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADV ADV SCONJ PRON VERB DET NOUN PART VERB PRON ADP ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN PRON AUX VERB PART VERB ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP ADV ADV NUM NOUN CCONJ AUX PART VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB DET NOUN ADV PRON AUX PART VERB ADV PRON AUX ADV ADJ ADP PRON PUNCT ADV PRON VERB PART VERB NOUN SCONJ SCONJ PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN DET NOUN AUX PRON VERB ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN PRON AUX PART VERB ADP ADV SCONJ PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADV PRON AUX ADV VERB NOUN ADP DET NUM NOUN NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX AUX VERB ADP DET NUM NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET ADV PRON AUX VERB DET ADJ PRON AUX AUX VERB ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET DET NOUN PRON AUX AUX ADJ SCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP ADV PRON AUX VERB SCONJ PRON AUX PART DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB ADP PRON ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PART VERB PRON ADJ NOUN ADV CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADV PUNCT ADV PRON VERB PART VERB VERB PRON NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PRON AUX PART ADV ADP DET NOUN ADV PUNCT DET NOUN PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN AUX PART AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN X PRON AUX DET NOUN VERB PART VERB ADP DET NOUN PRON AUX PART SCONJ SCONJ PRON AUX VERB PRON PART VERB ADV SCONJ PRON AUX VERB NOUN PRON AUX PRON NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PART DET PUNCT ADV VERB PART VERB ADP DET PROPN ADP ADP PRON PRON VERB ADV PRON VERB PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB VERB ADP PRON ADP PRON CCONJ VERB PRON PRON PRON AUX VERB ADV NUM SYM ADP PRON PRON VERB PART VERB ADV ADV AUX PART ADV VERB PART VERB ADP DET NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB DET DET NOUN ADV CCONJ PRON AUX DET NOUN PRON PRON AUX VERB CCONJ VERB PRON ADV PUNCT
