To champion dignity, respect

Why do people never read the Bible? Sodom was an anti rape story and Gomorrah was a passing mention. And you think this is history? LMAO

Claims he has ""nothing but love towards all people""
Calls homosexuality ""disgusting""

""irregardless of their lifestyle choices however disgusting they may be""
So you shouldn't have any problem with homosexuality then, seeing as it's not a lifestyle choice.

""but the truth still needs to be said, someone needs to speak out against this new found freedom to sin, have you no shame?""
The truth needs to be shown to be true. Demonstrate it is, objectively, a sin and we will listen.

Says ""i urge you to read the Holy Bible and learn the truth""
Doesn't understand Sodom was an anti rape story

""am sorry you need to go back and read the Bible, or anything that improves thought""

Gender : The state of being male or female.
Male : denoting the sex that produces gametes, especially spermatozoa.
Female : sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs.

Being of one sex but BELIEVING you are the other is a psychological disorder called Gender Dysphoria.



 Mandating widespread enabling of a psychological disorder is known as sociopathy.

Yet, the liberal developed Common Core National Sexually Education Standards has 10 YEAR OLDS REQUIRED TO ACCEPT AND VERBALLY CONFIRM THESE DAMAGING BEHAVIORS! 

Hitler would be so proud of the leftist brainwashing. 



Transgenderism Of Kids Is Ruled As CHILD ABUSE By American College Of Pediatrics. FINALLY, someone uses some common sense the ACP calls Transgenderism of kids child abuse.

1. Genetically, there are 2 SEXES, not genders. ""Sex"" refers to biological differences (hormones, genitalia etc), whereas gender refers to sociocultural norms associated with sex. (See WHO's website for details; see also Pavlov 2014). Conflating sex and gender really is a schoolboy error (or is that expression not considered PC enough?)

2. The science isn't settled that being transgender is a mental disease. You're either deliberately misinterpreting the facts or have misunderstood them.

3. Johns Hopkins has recently reopened its gender clinic, and now performs gender reassignment treatments after re-evaluating McHugh's findings. 

4. Citing McHugh alone ignores the scores of other psychiatrists whose findings differ greatly from those presented by McHugh (for example Colizzi et al, De Cuypere et al., and so on).

5. The methodology in Hopkins research was criticised for being flawed almost immediately after its publication. It judged patients to be ""poorly adjusted"" if they were involved in relationships with someone of the same sex post-transition. 

6. Thepublicdiscourse is run by a far-right think-tank, and can thus be discredited due to ideological interference. Present a more neutral source and you might have an argument.

7. McHugh's findings can also be discredited based on ideological conflict; in 1992, he admitted that his goal was to have the gender clinic at Johns Hopkins shut down after taking it over in 1975, 4 years before his ""findings"" were made public. Isn't that a swell coincidence? (See McHugh, 1992).

8. Gender dysphoria (arguably an offshoot of ego-dystonic sexual identity disorder) certainly exists, but not everyone who is trans suffers from it. 

9. You don't ""enable"" a mental disorder. They occur. Reassignment therapy can be seen as a form of treatment for those who suffer from gender dysphoria.

10. I actually agree that children should not undergo reassignment therapy, for the simple reason that their development has not finished, and thus it's possible that they may change as they advance through their teenage years. 

11. Hopkins is but one hospital. Their policy is not representative of other hospitals where reassignment therapy has proven
 to be a success over a prolonged period. 

12. You cite McHugh yet do not provide the name or coauthors of his work, nor do you explain the methodology. You're simply regurgitating the information that you found on a far right website. 

13. Johns Hopkins were quick to distance themselves from McHugh, contending that his research doesn't represent their views.

Gender : The state of being male or female.
Male : denoting the sex that produces gametes, especially spermatozoa.
Female : sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs.

Being of one sex but BELIEVING you are the other is a psychological disorder called Gender Dysphoria.



 Mandating widespread enabling of a psychological disorder is known as sociopathy.

Yet, the liberal developed Common Core National Sexually Education Standards has 10 YEAR OLDS REQUIRED TO ACCEPT AND VERBALLY CONFIRM THESE DAMAGING BEHAVIORS!

1465000670466164,"Sally-Ann & Margaret Hume. You clearly don't get what I was saying & quite frankly, what filthy language you use on social media.

There's no fraternising in barracks during training process which lasts a year. Man & Women are separated for the training process. Also, the reason a man has less time to run x miles or is required to to x more than a women, is because men are naturally stronger than women. So if a man becomes a woman, he's still got the male structure & strength regardless if he's decided to stick some tits in & wearing makeup. He's still a man. 

Also, i never claimed to be a highly desirable man to any sex. I simply said that that there's a reason man & woman are separated & a man transitioned to a woman, will have a significant advantage over other women. It's why transgender will not be able to compete in sports. Because a man still has the strength & physique of a man regardless to what he tries to become. Men run faster, hit harder & perform better than women, because men have a higher level of fitness, strength & stamina than women. So putting a man now a women with women to compete is unfair to women born as a woman.

Stupid !","Sally - Ann & Margaret hume . you clearly do not get what I be say & quite frankly , what filthy language you use on social media . there be no fraternising in barrack during training process which last a year . man & Women be separate for the training process . also , the reason a man have less time to run x mile or be require to to x more than a woman , be because man be naturally stronger than woman . so if a man become a woman , he be still get the male structure & strength regardless if he be decide to stick some tit in & wear makeup . he be still a man . also , i never claim to be a highly desirable man to any sex . I simply say that that there be a reason man & woman be separate & a man transition to a woman , will have a significant advantage over other woman . it be why transgender will not be able to compete in sport . because a man still have the strength & physique of a man regardless to what he try to become . Men run faster , hit harder & perform better than woman , because man have a higher level of fitness , strength & stamina than woman . so put a man now a woman with woman to compete be unfair to woman bear as a woman . call I whatever name you like . you be & will always be the sex you bear as . there be no way to physically prove you a woman trap in a man body , yet it be have law write for it .

106000710084355,"So, to take your points in turn:

1) There was a study performed by RAND Corp. in 2016 to determine the effects of having transgender people in the military, and the cost was determined to be negligible.  So, ultimately, ""cutting corners"" is not really all that necessary in this situation.

2) That study also examined several other military forces around the world that have transgender people enlisted and found no significant instances of loss of unit cohesion or morale.

3) That same study again noted that the number of transgender people serving between 1320 and 6630.  It's tough to get an accurate number because it's not something the DoD really tracks, but some estimates put it above 10,000.  That's not proven, though.

At any rate, I think the important thing is that for people serving in the military, beyond gender, beyond race, beyond background, beyond sexuality, you are first a soldier.  It's one of the first things you learn there.  As long as leadership is in place, then any gender, sexuality, or gender identity can serve alongside each other.  

No, it's not going to be perfect, and yes, there will probably be incidents, but I applaud these folks for their voluntary service.  I certainly didn't have the fortitude.

1621814207863127,"Ah, but there's a difference between doing ""what's best"", and doing something for political points.  

Did you know that this all started with the US House of Representatives arguing about whether Dept. of Defense funds should be used for gender reassignment surgery for transgender soldiers?  Because it might have led to a bill failing, something Trump didn't want to keep happening, House Republicans turned to him to address the idea of such funding.

So he said he was banning transgender people entirely.  Not just the surgery.  Not just those looking to seek surgery.  The entire transgender population of the US military, which number in the thousands.

Now I agree there's a hardy debate to be had about whether or not to use funds for such surgery, but the idea of using that as an opportunity to completely ban a group of people from serving is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

There are transgender people right now serving in the US military not seeking surgery, nor taking regular hormone treatments.  There are also people who have completed transitioning that don't need regular treatments.

So these are able people that are being denied their privilege to serve their country, when it has been proven via a study performed by RAND Corp in 2016 that not only is the monetary burden negligible, but also proved through referencing other countries that openly have transgender people serving (like the UK) that there is no effect on morale or unit cohesion.

I agree there are times to be doing things for the best even if some people don't like it (such as marriage equality being passed in the US two years ago), but you have to still do the work and learn whether it really is for the best, or if it's only to look good for certain people.",Acceptable speech,0,"Ah , but there 's a difference between doing "" what 's best "" , and doing something for political points .
